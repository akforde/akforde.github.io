# A.K. Forde Portfolio
Hi! I’m Amy Forde, a professional in transition with a curiosity and passion for all things tech. After building a 10+ year career in social services, I am pivoting to follow my passion for cybersecurity and technology, and I’m excited to dive in and gain hands-on experience.\

I love solving problems, learning new skills, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes—whether it’s securing systems or exploring innovative tech solutions. This portfolio is my way of sharing what I’m learning, the projects I’m passionate about, and my journey into the tech world.\

I am based in Calgary, Alberta. I’m always eager to connect with people in the industry, exchange ideas, and take on new challenges.
