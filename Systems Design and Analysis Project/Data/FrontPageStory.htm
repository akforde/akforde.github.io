      <p><font size="-1">April 30, 2013 - Futureville city council last night approved 
        city participation in a car sharing operation designed to address a number 
        of the city's transportation woes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">As part of a municipal transportation strategy, city 
        council committed to a forward-looking transportation policy, of which 
        the first stage is a car sharing system. Council approved a special budget 
        measure that allow the city's departments of Transportation and Environmental 
        Quality to finance a three-year pilot car sharing project that will be 
        operated out of city facilities. Councillor Darnell Waistcoat, responsible 
        for Transportation, stated that &quot;the initiative is an integral part 
        of the city's transportation future.&quot; When asked about the cost he 
        stated that &quot;all experiences with car sharing show that it is profitable 
        within 2-3 years. It's the right idea at the right time!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Car sharing is to automobiles what time-sharing is to 
        resort properties - a formal arrangement by a group of people to share 
        a resource. Many people do not need a car at all times, and their household's 
        first or second vehicle may not be used much. Being able to use a car 
        &quot;part-time&quot; may meet their mobility needs at a lower cost to 
        themselves and society.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-1">For those driving less than the average number of miles 
        a year, car sharing is less expensive than owning a car. Members in car 
        sharing organizations tend to use transit, walk, or bicyce for a significant 
        share of their transportation needs. Car sharing allows the added option 
        of a car to these transportation choices. </font></p>
      </td>
    <td width="33%"><font size="-1">Councillor Waistcoat was delighted that the 
      measure had finally passed. &quot;This starts to address the increasing 
      traffic congestion and parking problems that are blighting the city experience 
      for many people,&quot; he said. </font> 
      <p><font size="-1">Car sharing is expected to result in lower vehicle ownership 
        rates and lower overall vehicle distance traveled. In neighborhoods where 
        public parking is severely limited, fewer vehicles on the street will 
        improve the parking situation. Lower overall vehicle distance traveled 
        will result in reduced road congestion and in lower overall vehicle emissions. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">The Transportation department also committed to disposing 
        of some of its fleet of passenger vehicles and using car share vehicles 
        to fill the gap. &quot;It's a win-win situation,&quot; said Councillor 
        Wilbur Jenkins. &quot;The costs of car sharing are clearly less than those 
        of ownership below a certain level of usage.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Councillor James Bright was also enthusiastic about the 
        possibilities. &quot;We may consider providing incentives for incorporating 
        car sharing in future housing developments,&quot; the councillor stated. 
        &quot;This is as important as energy-efficient housing standards, and 
        will appeal to a new generation of renters and condo owners.&quot;</font></p>
